We are a dynamic research group, at the [The University of Melbourne](https://infrastructure.eng.unimelb.edu.au/). We are interested in understanding the inter-connection between concrete, the most-human-made material and Net Zero transition, the prime challenge at the time for the 2050 target and beyond. Increasing population and urbanisation have resulted in growing demands for concrete â€“ the material the becomes a topical Net Zero area due to the CO2 emission of cement production and natural resource consumption. On the other hand, to meet the Net Zero target by 2050, the energy transition and storage deployment is rapidly advancing worldwide, necessitating the construction of traditional and emerging energy infrastructure. As concrete has played a pivotal role in the modern society, from building a house to major civil and energy infrastructure, the CNN mission is to develop engineering solutions to advance the interdisciplinary nexus of concrete and energy research.
